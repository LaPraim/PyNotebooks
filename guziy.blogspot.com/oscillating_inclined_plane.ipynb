    "# Physics problem: A mass on an oscillating inclined plane\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem comes from the problem book by Savchenko et al. which I mentioned in the blog before. It is the last problem on harmonic oscillations in the edition I have (3.30*). Since I am posting it here, it means that the solution took me quite long time and I have still some points that are not completely clear to me (hoping someone will comment and clarify it for me :-)).\n",

    "**Problem statement** \n",
    "\n",
    "Given an inclined plane at an angle $\\alpha$ with respect to the horizon. The plane is oscillating harmonically at high frequency along the axis parallel to its surface and making the same angle $\\alpha$ with respect to the horizon (as shown in Fig. 1). The maximum speed of the oscillating plane is $v_0$. An object is then placed on the inclied plane. The friction coefficient between the plane and the object is $\\mu$. Assuming that $\\mu \\ll \\tan\\alpha$ determine how would the object move and its mean velocity after a long period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider the object in the reference frame tight to the oscillating plane. In this reference frame there would be the inertial force (varying harmonically) acting on the object and the object will oscillate up and down the inclined plane. Since the frequency of the oscillations of the plane is high, then we can consider that there are only two states of the object: it is moving upwards and downwards with respect to the plane. So the object will be oscillating on the plane up and down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take $T$ to be the period of the oscillation motion of the object. Which is equal to the period of oscillations of the plane.\n",

    "\n",
    "* $t_1$ - time it takes the object to travel up with respect to the plane\n",

    "The last term of the equation above is the force of inertia, assuming that the velocity of the inclined plane varies according to the formula $v(t)=v_0\\sin\\left( \\omega t + \\phi_0 \\right)$.\n",
